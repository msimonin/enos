#+BEGIN_abstract
OpenStack has become the de-facto solution to operate compute, network
and storage resources in public and private clouds. However,
developers and scientists are facing challenges when it comes to
deploy and benchmark such a complex software stack. This lab aims at
exploring EnOS[fn:enos-paper][fn:enos-code], a holistic framework
leveraging containers to conduct easy and reproducible evaluations of
different OpenStack configurations. In particular, EnOS helps you in
deploying real OpenStack infrastructure, stressing it and getting
feedback.

In this lab, we are going to:
- deploy and configure OpenStack using EnOS
- operate this OpenStack to manage IaaS resources (e.g. boot VMs)
- run some benchmarks to evaluate the deployment
- monitor metrics and visualize them through Grafana

* Requirements and Setup (TO BE DONE BEFORE THE LAB)
** Environment
To follow the lab you'll need :
- VirtualBox 5.1.22 [fn:virtualbox-downloads]
- Vagrant 1.9.5 or upper[fn:vagrant-downloads]
- Rescom17 Vagrant box[fn:enos-box] (contains EnOS with all its
  dependencies)

The lab makes use of a pre-installed virtual machine (lab vm) where
Enos is installed. Enos will then deploy OpenStack inside the lab-vm.

The following depicts the status of the different components in play
during the lab.

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTE
In a normal use Enos will be installed on your local machine directly.
Enos will also probably deploy OpenStack on a dedicated infrastructure
(instead of a single VM).
#+END_NOTE

** Setup the lab vm
*** Get the base box
Download the Rescom17 Vagrant box[fn:enos-box] in your working
directory.
: host:~$ mkdir rescom17-enos
: host:~$ cd rescom17-enos
: host:~/rescom17-enos$ curl http://enos.irisa.fr/vagrant-box/rescom17.box -O

#+BEGIN_NOTE
The box contains EnOS together with all resources needed by EnOS to
run OpenStack. The result is relatively huge (~6GB) box, but it
contains everything you need to run EnOS almost offline.
#+END_NOTE

While the box is downloading, you can proceed with the next section.

*** Prepare the lab VM
Create a ~Vagrantfile~ as the following (substitute <editor> with your
favorite editor):
: host:~/rescom17-enos$ <editor> Vagrantfile

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
# rescom17-enos/Vagrantfile content
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Location of the VM image
  config.vm.box = "file://./rescom17.box"

  # Network configuration
  config.vm.hostname = "enos-node"
  # the lab vm is started with 2 extra network interfaces with
  # the specified ip addresses
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.142.127"
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.143.127"

  # Synchronised `host:~/rescome-enos` with `enos-node:/vagrant_data`
  config.vm.synced_folder "./", "/vagrant_data",
     owner: "vagrant",
     group: "vagrant"

  # Resource configuration
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.cpus = 4
    vb.memory = 6144
  end
end
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTE
To get more information about that ~Vagranfile~ and its syntax, you
can refer to the official documentation[fn:vagrantfile].
#+END_NOTE

*** Start the lab VM
Start the lab VM :
: host:~/rescom17-enos$ vagrant up

SSH into the lab VM :
: host:~/rescom17-enos$ vagrant ssh

** Validate the setup
The EnOS tool is already installed in ~/opt/enos~. To be sure that
everything is setup correctly, you can go into the EnOS directory and
display the help message.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant@enos-node:~$ cd /opt/enos
vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ enos --help
Enos: Monitor and test your OpenStack.

usage: enos <command> [<args> ...] [-e ENV|--env=ENV]
            [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [-s|--silent|--vv]

...

Commands:
  up             Get resources and install the docker registry.
  os             Run kolla and install OpenStack.
  init           Initialise OpenStack with the bare necessities.
  bench          Run rally on this OpenStack.
  backup         Backup the environment
  ssh-tunnel     Print configuration for port forwarding with horizon.
  tc             Enforce network constraints
  info           Show information of the actual deployment.
  destroy        Destroy the deployment and optionally the related resources.
  deploy         Shortcut for enos up, then enos os and enos config.

See 'enos <command> --help' for more information on a specific
command.

** Hotfix
EnOS relies on OpenStack/kolla-ansible[fn:kolla-ansible] to deploy
OpenStack. Yesterday night (2017-06-19) kolla-ansible updated its code
base that breaks EnOS deployment. Before going further, please execute
the following:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ sed -i '68i\  openstack_release: 4.0.2\' reservation.yaml

* Deploy OpenStack using EnOS
** The EnOS configuration file
To deploy OpenStack, Enos reads a /configuration/ file. This file
states the OpenStack resources you want to measure together with their
topology. A configuration could say, "Deploy a basic OpenStack on a
single node", or "Put OpenStack control services on ClusterA and
compute services on ClusterB", but also "Deploy each OpenStack
services on a dedicated node and add WAN network latency between
them". So that EnOS can deploy such OpenStack over your testbed and
run performance analysis.

The description of the configuration is done in a ~reservation.yaml~
file, under the ~resources~ key. Way you describe your configuration
may vary a little bit depending on the testbed you target. The actual
EnOS implementation supports Vagrant (VBox), Grid’5000 and Chameleon
testbed. Please, refer to the EnOS provider
documentation[fn:enos-provider] to find examples of resources
description depending on the testbed.

For the sake of this lab (since everybody does not have a
Grid’5000/Chameleon account, nor plenty of available resources on his
personal machine for VBox, and the Internet connection may be slow) we
provide a configuration that says to deploy all OpenStack services on
the lab machine using a special testbed we call static. You can read
that configuration in the lab vm with:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ less /opt/enos/reservation.yaml

** Deploy OpenStack
EnOS manages all the aspect of an OpenStack deployment by calling
~enos deploy~. Concretely, the ~deploy~ phase first gets resources on
your testbed following your configuration description. Then,
provisions these resources with Docker. And finally, starts each
OpenStack services (e.g. Keystone, Nova, Neutron, ...) inside a
dedicated Docker container.

Launch the deployment with:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ enos deploy -f reservation.yaml

Then, observe EnOS deploying containers from another terminal of your
VM with:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ sudo docker ps

** Play with OpenStack
The last service deployed is the OpenStack dashboard (Horizon). Once
the deployment process is finished, Horizon is reachable from the web
browser of your host machine http://192.168.142.127 with the following
credentials:
- login: ~admin~
- password: ~demo~

From here, you can reach ~Project > Compute > Instances > Launch
Instance~ and boot a virtual machine given the following information:
- a name (e.g., ~horizon-vm~)
- an image (e.g., ~cirros.uec~)
- a flavor to limit the resources of your instance (I recommend
  ~tiny~)
- and a network setting (must be ~private~)

You should select options by clicking on the arrow on the right of
each possibility. When the configuration is OK, the ~Launch Instance~
button should be enabled. After clicking on it, you should see the
instance in the ~Active~ state in less than a minute.

Now, you have several option to connect to your freshly deployed VM.
For instance, by clicking on its name Horizon provides a virtual
console under the tab ~Console~. Use the following credentials to
access the VM:
- login: ~cirros~
- password: ~cubswin:)~

While Horizon is helpful to discover OpenStack features, this is not
how a true operator administrates OpenStack. A true operator prefers
command line interface 😄.

*** Unleash the Operator in You
OpenStack provides a command line interface to operate your Cloud. But
before using it, you need first set your environment with OpenStack
credentials, so that the command line won't bother you by requiring
credentials each time.

Load the OpenStack credentials:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ source current/admin-openrc

You can then check that your environment is correctly set by:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ env|grep OS_
OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default
OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID=default
OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
OS_PASSWORD=demo
OS_AUTH_URL=http://192.168.142.103:35357/v3
OS_USERNAME=admin
OS_TENANT_NAME=admin
OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
#+END_EXAMPLE

All operations to manage OpenStack are done through one single command
line, called ~openstack~. Doing an ~openstack --help~ displays the
really long list of possibilities provided by this command. Next gives
you a selection of most often used commands to operate your Cloud:
- List OpenStack running services :: ~openstack endpoint list~
- List images :: ~openstack image list~
- List flavors :: ~openstack flavor list~
- List networks :: ~openstack network list~
- List computes :: ~openstack hypervisor list~
- List VMs (running or not) :: ~openstack server list~
- Get details on a specific VM :: ~openstack server show <vm-name>~
- Start a new VM :: ~openstack server create --image <image-name> --flavor <flavor-name> --nic net-id=<net-id> <vm-name>~
- View VMs logs :: ~openstack console log show <vm-name>~

Using all these commands, you can use the cli to start a new tiny
cirros VM called ~cli-vm~:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ openstack server create\
  --image cirros.uec\
  --flavor m1.tiny\
  --nic net-id=$(openstack network show private --column id --format value)\
  cli-vm
#+END_EXAMPLE

And then display information about your VM with the following command.
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ openstack server show cli-vm
Note in particular the status of your VM. This status will go from
~BUILD~: OpenStack is looking for the best place to boot the VM, to
~ACTIVE~: your VM is running. The status could also be ~ERROR~ if you
are experiencing hard times with your infrastructure.

With the previous ~openstack sever create~ command, the VM boot with a
private IP. Private IPs are used for communication between VMs,
meaning you cannot ping your VM from the lab machine. Network lovers
will find a challenge here: try to ping the VM from the lab machine.
For the others, you have to manually affect a floating IP to your
machine if you want it pingable from the lab.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ openstack server add floating ip\
  cli-vm\
  $(openstack floating ip create public -c floating_ip_address -f value)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then, ask for the status of your VM and its IPs with:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ openstack server show cli-vm -c status -c addresses

When the state is ~ACTIVE~ wait one minute or two, the time for the VM
to boot. Then you can ping it on its floating IP and SSH on it:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ ping <floating-ip> # floating-ip is 192.168.143.*
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ ssh -l cirros <floating-ip>

#+BEGIN_NOTE
You can check that the VM finished to boot by looking at its logs with
~openstack console log show cli-vm~. The VM finished to boot when last
lines are:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
=== cirros: current=0.3.4 uptime=16.56 ===
  ____               ____  ____
 / __/ __ ____ ____ / __ \/ __/
/ /__ / // __// __// /_/ /\ \
\___//_//_/  /_/   \____/___/
   http://cirros-cloud.net


login as 'cirros' user. default password: 'cubswin:)'. use 'sudo' for root.
cli-vm login:
#+END_EXAMPLE
#+END_NOTE

Before going to the next section, feel free to play around with the
~openstack~ cli and Horizon. For instance, list all features offered
by Nova with ~openstack server --help~ and try to figure out how to
SSH on ~cli-vm~ using its name rather than its floating IP.

* Stress and Visualize OpenStack Behavior using EnOS
EnOS not only deploys OpenStack according to your configuration, but
also instruments it with a /monitoring stack/. The monitoring stack
gets performance characteristics of the running services and helps you
in understanding the behavior of your OpenStack.

Activating the monitoring stack is as simple as setting the
~enable_monitoring~ to ~yes~ in your ~reservation.yaml~. This key
tells EnOS to deploy two monitoring system. First,
cAdvisor[fn:cadvisor], a tool to collect resource usage of running
containers. Using cAdvisor, EnOS gives information about the
CPU/RAM/Network consumption per cluster/node/service. Second,
Collectd[fn:collectd], a tool to collect performance data of specific
applications. Using Collectd, EnOS gives the number of updates that
have been performed on the Nova database for instance.

The rest of this section, first shows how to visualize cAdvisor and
Collectd information. Then, it presents tools to stress OpenStack in
order to collect interesting information.

** Visualize OpenStack Behavior
A popular tool to visualize information provided by cAdvisor and
Collectd (and whatever monitoring system you could use) is
Grafana[fn:grafana]. Grafana is a web metrics dashboard and is
reachable from the browser of your host machine at
http://192.168.142.127:3000 with the following credentials:
- login: ~admin~
- password: ~admin~

The dashboard of Grafana is highly customizable. For the sake of
simplicity, we propose to use our configuration file that you can get
with:
: host:~/rescom17-enos$ curl http://enos.irisa.fr/vagrant-box/grafana_dashboard_rescom2017.json -O

You have then to import this file into Grafana. First, click on the
~Grafana logo > Dashboard > Import > Upload .json file~ and select the
=~/rescom17-enos/grafana_dashboard_rescom2017.json= file. Next, make
names of the right column matching names of the left column by
selecting the good item in the list. And finish by clicking on ~Save &
Open~. This opens the dashboard with several measures on Nova,
Neutron, Keystone, RabbitMQ, ... services.

Keep the dashboard open until the end of the lab, you will see
consumption variation as we will perform stress tests. Eventually, you
will see vertical bars (red, green and blue) crossing your graphs.
These bars indicates a special action launched by EnOS.

** Benchmark OpenStack
Stressing a Cloud manager could be split in two categories: /control
plane/ and /data plane/, and so it is for OpenStack. The control plane
stresses OpenStack API. That is to say, features we used in the
previous section to start a VM, get a floating IP, and all features
listed by ~openstack --help~. The data plane stresses the usage of
resources provided by an OpenStack feature. For instance, a network
data plane testing tool will measure how resources provided by Neutron
handle networks communications.

OpenStack comes with dedicated tools that provide workload to stress
control and data plane. The one for control plane is called
Rally[fn:rally] and the one for data plane is called
Shaker[fn:shaker]. And these two are well integrated into EnOS.

Calling Rally and Shaker from EnOS is done with:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ enos bench --workload=workload

#+BEGIN_NOTE
At the same time as ~enos bench~ running, keep an eye on the Grafana
dashboard available at http://192.168.142.127:3000. At the top left of
the page, you can click on the clock icon ⌚ and tells Grafana to
automatically refresh every 5 seconds and only display the last 5
minutes.
#+END_NOTE

EnOS looks at ~workload~ directory for a file named ~run.yml~. This
file is the description of the workload to launch. Listing [[lst:run]]
shows the definition of the ~run.yml~ provided in this lab. The
[[(rally)][~rally~]] key specifies the list of [[(scn)][~scenarios~]] to execute (here, only
~boot and list servers~ that asks Nova to boot VMs and list them) and
their customization. The customization could be done by using the top
level [[(top-arg)][~args~]]. In such case, it applies to any scenario. For instance
here, [[(conc)][~concurrency~]] and [[(times)][~times~]] tells Rally to launch ~5~ OpenStack
client for a total of ~10~ execution of every scenario. The
customization could also be done per scenario with the dedicated
[[(scn-arg)][~args~]], and thus only applies to the specific scenario. For instance
here, the ~30~ value overrides the ~sla_max_avg_duration~ default
value solely in the ~boot and list servers~ scenario.

#+BEGIN_NOTE
Note that Shaker workload is [[(disabled)][disabled]] because the lab machines doesn't
provides enough resources to launch it. Refer to the [[*Add Traffic Shaping (optional -- non static testbed only)][next section]] to
see how to deploy OpenStack on a decent testbed and thus execute this
test.
#+END_NOTE

Rally and Shaker provide a huge list of scenarios on their respective
GitHub[fn:rally-scenarios][fn:shaker-scenarios]. Before going further,
go through the Rally list and try to add the scenario of your choice
into the ~run.yml~. Note that you have to download the scenario file
in the ~workload~ directory and then put a new item under the
[[(scn)][~scenarios~]] key. The new item should contain, at least, the ~name~ of
the scenario and its ~file~ path (relative to the ~workload~
directory).

** Backup your results
Rally and Shaker produce reports on executed scenarios. For instance,
Rally produces a report with the full duration, load mean duration,
number of iteration and percent of failures, per scenario. These
reports, plus data measured by cAdvisor and Collectd, plus logs of
every OpenStack services can be backup by EnOS with:
: vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ enos backup --backup_dir=/vagrant_data

The argument ~backup_dir~ tells where to store backup archives. For
this lab, we recommend to put backup in ~/vagrant_data~. The
~/vagrant_data~ is a specific directory shared with the
=~/rescom17-enos= of the host machine. If you look into this
directory, you will see, among others, an archive named
~enos-node-rally.tar.gz~. Concretely, this archive contains a backup
of Rally database with all raw data and the Rally reports. You can
extract the rally report with the following command and then open it
in your favorite browser:
: host:~/rescom17-enos$ tar -x root/rally_home/report.html -f enos-node-rally.tar.gz
: host:~/rescom17-enos$ firefox root/rally_home/report.html

If you look carefully, you will see that execution of Nova boot and
list fails because of a SLA violation. You can try to customize
listing [[lst:run]] to make the test pass.

** Integration with a custom benchmarking suite
EnOS exposes information it gathered during the deployment with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
vagrant@enos-node:/opt/enos$ enos info --out json
{"resultdir": "/opt/enos/enos_2017-06-18T14:52:54.341891", "config_file": "./reservation.yaml", "eths": ["eth1", "eth2"], "provider_net": {"start": "192.168.143.3", "end": "192.168.143.119", "dns": "8.8.8.8", "extra_ips": [], "cidr": "192.168.143.0/24", "gateway": "192.168.143.1"}, "user": "", "phase": "", "nodes": {}, "rsc": {"control": [{"extra": {}, "alias": "enos-node", "user": "root", "address": "127.0.0.1", "keyfile": null, "port": null}], "compute": [{"extra": {}, "alias": "enos-node", "user": "root", "address": "127.0.0.1", "keyfile": null, "port": null}], "network": [{"extra": {}, "alias": "enos-node", "user": "root", "address": "127.0.0.1", "keyfile": null, "port": null}]}, "config": {"resultdir": "/opt/enos/enos_2017-06-18T14:52:54.341891", "kolla_ref": "stable/ocata", "influx_vip": "192.168.142.102", "vip": "192.168.142.103", "registry_vip": "192.168.142.104", "grafana_vip": "192.168.142.101", "backup_dir": "/vagrant_data", "kolla_repo": "https://git.openstack.org/openstack/kolla-ansible", "inventory": "inventories/inventory.sample", "external_vip": "192.168.142.100", "enable_monitoring": true, "kolla": {"kolla_base_distro": "centos", "kolla_install_type": "source", "docker_namespace": "beyondtheclouds", "enable_heat": "no", "node_custom_config": "patch/"}, "provider": {"type": "static", "eths": ["eth1", "eth2"], "network": {"start": "192.168.143.3", "end": "192.168.143.119", "dns": "8.8.8.8", "extra_ips": ["192.168.142.100", "192.168.142.101", "192.168.142.102", "192.168.142.103", "192.168.142.104"], "cidr": "192.168.143.0/24", "gateway": "192.168.143.1"}}, "database_password": "demo", "registry": {"ceph": false}, "rabbitmq_password": "demo", "resources": {"control": {"alias": "enos-node", "user": "root", "address": "127.0.0.1"}, "compute": {"alias": "enos-node", "user": "root", "address": "127.0.0.1"}, "network": {"alias": "enos-node", "user": "root", "address": "127.0.0.1"}}, "network_interface": "eth1"}, "inventory": "/opt/enos/enos_2017-06-18T14:52:54.341891/multinode"}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Someone can easily reuse this information to integrate its own
benchmarking suite in an ah-doc manner.

* Add Traffic Shaping (optional -- non static testbed only)
EnOS allows to enforce network emulation in terms of latency,
bandwidth limitation and packet loss. Unfortunately, the lab machine
provided here doesn't support this feature. The reason is simple:
enforcing traffic shaping with the current version of EnOS requires to
deploy OpenStack services on different nodes, but the lab machines
deploys all services on a single node.

To do this part you need a Grid'5000 account or a good machine that
supports to start 4 VBox VMs. If you choose the Grid'5000, please
refer to EnOS documentation for EnOS
installation[fn:enos-g5k-provider] (same with Vagrant +
VBox[fn:enos-vagrant-provider]). In case of Vagrant + VBox, we
recommend to configure your provider as following, so you do not have
to download all OpenStack docker images:
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
provider:
  type: vagrant
  box: "file://~/rescom17-enos/rescom17.box"
#+END_SRC

** Define Network Constraints
Network constraints (latency/bandwidth limitations) are enabled by the
use of groups of nodes. Resources must be described using a ~topology~
description instead of a ~resources~ description. For instance,
listings [[lst:topos-g5k]] and [[lst:topos-vgt]] define three groups named
grp1, grp2 and grp3.

@@html:<div style='display:flex'>@@
#+ATTR_HTML: style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 20px 20px;"
#+CAPTION: Description of a topology for Grid'5000.
#+NAME: lst:topos-g5k
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
topology:
  grp1:
    paravance:
      control: 1
      network: 1
  grp[2-3]:
    paravance:
      compute: 1
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_HTML: style="float:right;margin:0px 0px 20px 20px;"
#+CAPTION: Description of a topology for Vagrant + VBox.
#+NAME: lst:topos-vgt
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
topology:
  grp1:
    large:
      control: 1
      network: 1
  grp[2-3]:
    medium:
      compute: 1
#+END_SRC
@@html:</div>@@

Constraints are then described under the ~network_constraints~ key in
the ~reservation.yaml~ file:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
network_constraints:
  enable: true
  default_delay: 25ms
  default_rate: 100mbit
  default_loss: 0.1%
  constraints:
    - src: grp1
      dst: grp[2-3]
      delay: 50ms
      rate: 1gbit
      loss: 0%
      symetric: true
#+END_SRC

And enforce these constraints with ~enos tc~, which results in:
- Network delay between machines of ~grp1~ and the machines of the
  other groups is 100ms (2x50ms: symmetric).
- Bandwidth between machines of ~grp1~ and the machines of the other
  groups is 1 Gbit/s.
- Packet loss percentage between machines of ~grp1~ and the machines
  of the other groups is 0%.
- Network delay between machines of ~grp2~ and ~grp3~ is 50ms.
- Bandwidth between machines of ~grp2~ and ~grp3~ is 100Mbit/s.
- Packet loss percentage between machines of ~grp2~ and ~grp3~ is
  0.1%.

#+BEGIN_NOTE
To call ~enos tc~, resources must be available, thus ~enos deploy~
must have been called before.
#+END_NOTE

*** Checking the constraints
Invoking ~enos tc --test~ generates various reports to validate the
constraints. They are based on ~fping~ and ~flent~ latency and
bandwidth measurements respectively. The report is located in the
result directory.

** Run Dataplane Benchmarks with and without DVR
Run a first time the Shaker ~dense_l3_east_west~ scenario. In this
scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances on the same compute node.
Instances are connected to different tenant networks connected to one
router. The traffic goes from one network to the other (L3 east-west).
Get the Shaker report with ~enos backup~ and analyze it. You will
remark that network communications between two VMs co-located on the
same compute are 100ms RTT. This is because packet are routed by
Neutron service that is inside ~grp1~ and VMs are inside the ~grp2~
(or ~grp3~).

Now, reconfigure Neutron to use DVR[fn:dvr]. DVR will push Neutron
agent directly on compute of ~grp2~ and ~grp3~. With EnOS, you should
do so by updating the ~reservation.yaml~ and add ~enable_dvr: "yes"~
under the ~kolla~ key. Then call the following line to tell EnOS to
reconfigure Neutron:
: enos os --tags=neutron --reconfigure

Finally, re-execute the ~dense_l3_east_west~ scenario and compare your
result with previous one. You will see that you no more pay the cost
of WAN latency.

This experiment shows the importance of activating DVR in a WAN
context, and how you can easily show that using EnOS. Do not hesitate
to take a look at the complete list of Shaker scenarios on their
GitHub[fn:shaker-scenarios] and continue to have fun with EnOS.
